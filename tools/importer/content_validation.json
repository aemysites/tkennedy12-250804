PwC US has been working with a leading pharma company to improve the process. With alliance partners AWS and Microsoft, PwC US used data analytics and GenAI to design a new clinical trial and integrated tech platform. The results were significant: costs were reduced, the findings were more precise, time was cut by 20\u201325% and revenue increased by more than US$100 million. This approach could revolutionise a wide range of drug trials, benefiting patients and accelerating treatments. Driving evolution in health. With 130 clubs and 750,000 members, David Lloyd Health Clubs wanted to evolve. Together with PwC UK, they launched an ambitious AI-driven transformation to enhance member experiences, deliver operational efficiencies and become a holistic health and well-being brand.
