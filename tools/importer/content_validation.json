PwC US has been working with a leading pharma company to improve the process. With alliance partners AWS and Microsoft, PwC US used data analytics and GenAI to design a new clinical trial and integrated tech platform. The results were significant: costs were reduced, the findings were more precise, time was cut by 20\u201325% and revenue increased by more than US$100 million. This approach could revolutionise a wide range of drug trials, benefiting patients and accelerating treatments. Driving evolution in health. With 130 clubs and 750,000 members, David Lloyd Health Clubs wanted to evolve. Together with PwC UK, they launched an ambitious AI-driven transformation to enhance member experiences, deliver operational efficiencies and become a holistic health and well-being brand. From integrating cloud-based SaaS solutions, improving business intelligence and simplifying processes, to deploying AI chatbots to enhance member interactions. PwC\u2019s AI consultants helped them create success today and lay the foundations for tomorrow. Mitigating flood disasters. Floods have displaced 24 million people and caused US$453 billion in damages in the past decade. PwC Middle East\u2019s AI-driven flood resilience tool uses geospatial AI to create dynamic, real-time simulations of potential flooding scenarios, incorporating data on topography, rainfall, cyclones and proximity to the ocean. The 3D visualisations make it easy to understand the likely flow of the flood\u2014helping government agencies, emergency services, insurance companies and homeowners mitigate loss and harm for the future."

Our values guide our actions. Our behaviours are how we bring it to life. Purpose, values and behaviours Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems. In an increasingly complex world, we help intricate systems function, adapt and evolve so they can deliver sustained outcomes for communities and society \u2013 whether they are capital markets, tax systems or the economic systems within which business and society exist. Creating a common purpose will help to steer business through the next stage of evolution, as the systems upon which economies and societies depend are disrupted and evolve.

The PwC Professional | Our behaviours Our behaviours define how we bring our purpose, strategy and values to life. When you consider the expectations of our clients, our people and society, one thing is clear: we must evolve to keep pace with the needs of a rapidly changing world. Doing so requires new skills, new ways of thinking, and new capabilities that are consistent across our network. We need a different way to lead and deliver value. And we must begin with integrity. Trusted Leadership and Distinctive Outcomes are how we deliver on our purpose and strategy, serving our clients and living our values in every interaction, everyday. Guided by Trusted Leadership and Distinctive Outcomes, we'll work to create a better tomorrow. At PwC we believe it is our obligation - and our opportunity - to take the lead and work together for a better tomorrow. This means our purpose, strategy, and values working as a system: Our purpose grounds our existence. Our strategy directs our focus. Our values guide our actions. And the PwC Professional describes how we behave to bring it to life. And when we behave in this way, we unlock the full potential of our global network. We become an unrivalled place to work and solve together for our clients and society. Our Code of Conduct The trust that our clients, our communities and our people place in PwC, and our high standards of ethical behaviour, are fundamental to everything we do.
